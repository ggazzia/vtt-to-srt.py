Hi.

2
00:00:01.934 --> 00:00:04.100
Let's continue with
our look at the case

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.467
Alternative Distribution
at Sugar Sweets,

4
00:00:06.467 --> 00:00:11.834
Incorporated Now just a
recap where we are at the

5
00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:14.300
moment: in the last
session we looked at the

6
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.867
Sugar Sweets alternative
distribution concept.

7
00:00:18.867 --> 00:00:22.834
Then we looked at Sugar
Sweets' estimates of how

8
00:00:22.834 --> 00:00:26.100
many retailers would
participate and what the

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.867
sales of the retailers
would be to end consumers.

10
00:00:31.867 --> 00:00:33.700
Now we're going to
conclude the case by

11
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.233
looking at Sugar Sweets
and the cost that Sugar

12
00:00:37.233 --> 00:00:41.567
Sweets would incur,
their revenues, and their

13
00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:45.667
expected or anticipated
profits, and we'll also

14
00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:48.100
talk about some other
factors that affect this

15
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.734
decision from the
standpoint of Sugar Sweets.

16
00:00:52.734 --> 00:00:57.533
Now, the next several
slides have an enormous

17
00:00:57.533 --> 00:01:02.767
number of calculations in
them and I'm not really

18
00:01:02.767 --> 00:01:07.333
going to go through the
detail of each of the

19
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:11.166
calculations on
each of the slides.

20
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:15.166
Now after this session is
completed, you can go to

21
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:19.934
the course website and
you will find there a file

22
00:01:19.934 --> 00:01:23.400
that has all of these
slides included so that

23
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.433
you can see the detail of
the calculations that I've

24
00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:32.233
conducted in the
Sugar Sweets analysis.

25
00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:35.233
The first thing we need
to do is to determine the

26
00:01:35.233 --> 00:01:38.934
number of orders that
Sugar Sweets expects it

27
00:01:38.934 --> 00:01:42.367
will receive from
retailers as retailers

28
00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:46.433
need to be supplied with
the product to meet the

29
00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:50.867
demand of the, the,
the consumers.

30
00:01:50.867 --> 00:01:56.734
And so I've taken data
from ah, our last, our

31
00:01:56.734 --> 00:02:01.600
last session and keeping
in mind that Sugar Sweets

32
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.066
expects some of the
retailers to perform well

33
00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:09.066
above average and others
to perform below average

34
00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:13.100
and some to be average
performers, from that data

35
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.934
we find that in terms of
the large display packs,

36
00:02:17.934 --> 00:02:20.834
Sugar Sweets expects
that in the trial period

37
00:02:20.834 --> 00:02:29.233
there'll be slightly over
22,000 retailers who will participate.

38
00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:34.867
Ah, we also find then that
of course that in terms of

39
00:02:34.867 --> 00:02:38.867
the initial orders from
these re - from these

40
00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:42.066
retailers who want the
large display packs, the

41
00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:45.300
initial order would
clearly be slightly over

42
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.600
22,000 and these orders
would have to be fulfilled

43
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.734
by Sugar Sweets through
one of its two alternative

44
00:02:54.734 --> 00:03:01.233
ah, networks of
distribution centers.

45
00:03:01.233 --> 00:03:08.166
Now during, during
the trial period, the

46
00:03:08.166 --> 00:03:12.667
retailers will have to
place reorders to

47
00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:16.500
restock their display
cases and if we look at

48
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.600
the number of reorders
from the different ah,

49
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.567
performing - performance
levels we, we find that

50
00:03:24.567 --> 00:03:28.667
during the trial period
we expect, or Sugar Sweets

51
00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:35.066
expects to have over
110,000 reorders of the

52
00:03:35.066 --> 00:03:39.166
large display packs.

53
00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:42.867
Ah, on the other hand,
following the same basic

54
00:03:42.867 --> 00:03:47.333
process and the same basic
logic, during the trial

55
00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:52.767
period ah, they expect
that they'll have slightly

56
00:03:52.767 --> 00:03:57.266
over 27,000 retailers
who will want the small

57
00:03:57.266 --> 00:03:59.734
display packs.

58
00:03:59.734 --> 00:04:03.867
So the initial orders from
those retailers will be

59
00:04:03.867 --> 00:04:09.433
slightly over 27,000
orders and then given the

60
00:04:09.433 --> 00:04:12.166
fact that these are the
small display packs, they

61
00:04:12.166 --> 00:04:19.300
will have to fulfill many
more reorders from the retailers.

62
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.467
In fact, during the
pretrial or during the

63
00:04:22.467 --> 00:04:31.300
trial period, over
292,000 reorders.

64
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.767
And then there's the
situation after the

65
00:04:33.767 --> 00:04:36.066
post-trial period.

66
00:04:36.066 --> 00:04:39.333
And keeping in mind that
not all of the retailers

67
00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:43.500
who, who began the program
will continue after the

68
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.133
six-month trial period; in
fact the estimate on the

69
00:04:49.133 --> 00:04:52.367
part of Sugar Sweets
is that after the trial

70
00:04:52.367 --> 00:04:57.066
period, there will be
a little over 12,000

71
00:04:57.066 --> 00:05:03.667
retailers who will want
the large display packs

72
00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:09.166
and they will need to
place about 7 - a little

73
00:05:09.166 --> 00:05:13.834
over 73,000 reorders
during the six-month

74
00:05:13.834 --> 00:05:18.100
post-trial period.

75
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.500
In terms of the small pack
retailers: again there

76
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.400
will be a dropout rate,
so there'll be close to

77
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:31.266
15,000 retailers remaining
in the program for, for

78
00:05:31.266 --> 00:05:34.667
wanting the small display packs.

79
00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:39.200
And to resupply the, these
retailers who want the

80
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.600
small display packs will
involve filling over

81
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.900
175,000 reorders.

82
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:59.266
So to summarize, what's the summary to all of this process?

83
00:05:59.266 --> 00:06:05.500
What Sugar Sweets expects
is that during the first

84
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:11.934
year it will have a
total number of orders to

85
00:06:11.934 --> 00:06:18.133
fulfill on the large
display pack of 205,000,

86
00:06:18.133 --> 00:06:22.066
almost 206,000.

87
00:06:22.066 --> 00:06:27.767
And for the small display
packs it will have 400,

88
00:06:27.767 --> 00:06:37.300
almost 495,000 orders to fill.

89
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:43.166
So given these estimates,
Sugar Sweets anticipates

90
00:06:43.166 --> 00:06:49.200
that its revenue from
sales of the large packs

91
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.667
will be over $42
million dollars.

92
00:06:53.667 --> 00:06:57.033
It anticipates that its
revenue from sales of the

93
00:06:57.033 --> 00:07:01.767
small display packs
including the reorders

94
00:07:01.767 --> 00:07:08.333
will be almost $57 million
dollars for total revenue

95
00:07:08.333 --> 00:07:14.066
of a little over $99
million dollars.

96
00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:17.533
Now we have to
look at the cost.

97
00:07:17.533 --> 00:07:21.066
Now we do have two
alternative ah, logistics

98
00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:24.533
networks, one involving
three distribution

99
00:07:24.533 --> 00:07:27.166
centers, the other
involving four

100
00:07:27.166 --> 00:07:29.633
distribution centers.

101
00:07:29.633 --> 00:07:34.700
Let's look at the
three-distribution-center alternative.

102
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.600
Their estimate of cost of
filling the orders for the

103
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.967
large display packs is a
little over $2 million and

104
00:07:43.967 --> 00:07:46.000
their estimate of
logistics costs for the

105
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.834
small packs, display packs, is a little over $5 million.

106
00:07:51.834 --> 00:07:56.233
So the total logistics
cost involved will be

107
00:07:56.233 --> 00:08:00.233
slightly over $7 million.

108
00:08:00.233 --> 00:08:05.100
Again, with annual
revenue of $99 million.

109
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.200
But of course there's
also the production cost.

110
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.734
And if we look at the
production cost of the

111
00:08:11.734 --> 00:08:14.533
large packs and the
small packs combined, the

112
00:08:14.533 --> 00:08:21.467
production cost is over
$87 Â½ million dollars.

113
00:08:21.467 --> 00:08:25.667
Finally, there's the cost
involved in the display

114
00:08:25.667 --> 00:08:32.266
ah, the display cases
themselves, which total

115
00:08:32.266 --> 00:08:35.100
for both the large
displays and the small

116
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:40.967
displays a little over
$1.2 million dollars.

117
00:08:40.967 --> 00:08:45.367
If we add all of the cost
up - the production cost,

118
00:08:45.367 --> 00:08:49.333
the display cost, and the
logistics cost - we have

119
00:08:49.333 --> 00:08:53.033
total cost of
almost $96 million.

120
00:08:53.033 --> 00:09:02.000
We had revenue of slightly
over 90, $99 million, so

121
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.800
the estimated profit at
Sugar Sweets for the ah,

122
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:20.133
alternative using three distribution centers is $3,154,928.

123
00:09:20.133 --> 00:09:22.734
If you use similar logic
for the four distr -

124
00:09:22.734 --> 00:09:25.633
four-distribution-center
alternative, you actually

125
00:09:25.633 --> 00:09:36.000
have a slightly larger profit of a little over $3,330,000.

126
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.133
So the profitability
analysis conducted by

127
00:09:39.133 --> 00:09:44.200
Sugar Sweets ah, does make
this alternative

128
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.633
distribution channel
program ah, look somewhat

129
00:09:48.633 --> 00:09:52.467
attractive in terms
of profitability.

130
00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:56.533
It'll add, in their
estimate, given the market

131
00:09:56.533 --> 00:10:01.266
research they've done,
it will add over three

132
00:10:01.266 --> 00:10:04.133
million dollars to the
profitability of the, of

133
00:10:04.133 --> 00:10:07.667
the organization.

134
00:10:07.667 --> 00:10:11.734
What else do we
have to consider?

135
00:10:11.734 --> 00:10:16.967
Well, in the real
situation on which Sugar

136
00:10:16.967 --> 00:10:21.000
Sweets is based, one of
the first things that was

137
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.800
noticed is that the
analysis was based on

138
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:31.633
production cost, logistics
cost, and cost of the displays.

139
00:10:31.633 --> 00:10:34.266
There was some other cost
that were actually not

140
00:10:34.266 --> 00:10:39.800
even included in the, in
their initial analysis.

141
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.266
There'd been little
consideration given to the

142
00:10:42.266 --> 00:10:47.567
fact that ah, Sugar Sweets
was going to have to

143
00:10:47.567 --> 00:10:53.400
establish a call center,
a telemarketing center in

144
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:59.500
order to, to recruit
potential retailers and

145
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:04.033
also to actually take or
receive the orders and

146
00:11:04.033 --> 00:11:06.834
reorders from retailers.

147
00:11:06.834 --> 00:11:10.700
They really hadn't thought
through all the different

148
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:15.300
functions that the company
was going to have to perform.

149
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:20.233
They were so used to the
fact that they, they dealt

150
00:11:20.233 --> 00:11:24.367
with the candy and tobacco
jobbers, they really

151
00:11:24.367 --> 00:11:27.033
forgot about the fact that
they were now going to

152
00:11:27.033 --> 00:11:30.567
have to take over many
of the functions that the

153
00:11:30.567 --> 00:11:35.100
candy and tobacco
jobbers were performing.

154
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:41.133
There are also a lot of risks that they needed to consider.

155
00:11:41.133 --> 00:11:46.100
First of all, the entire
analysis ah, is heavily

156
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:50.934
reliant on their, their
assumptions related to the

157
00:11:50.934 --> 00:11:54.467
number of retailers who
will participate and the

158
00:11:54.467 --> 00:11:57.333
number of sales made to
consumers, the number of

159
00:11:57.333 --> 00:11:59.667
orders, et cetera.

160
00:11:59.667 --> 00:12:04.200
And if those assumptions
are incorrect ah, their,

161
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:10.233
the entire analysis
is quite flawed.

162
00:12:10.233 --> 00:12:14.300
One of the questions that
if - that you may remember

163
00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:18.834
or one of the points you
may remember in the case

164
00:12:18.834 --> 00:12:23.066
is that Sugar Sweets
was basing the, their

165
00:12:23.066 --> 00:12:27.900
estimates on retailer
participation on the fact

166
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.133
that retailers would
be very anxious to

167
00:12:30.133 --> 00:12:33.967
participate because they'd
be able to earn high

168
00:12:33.967 --> 00:12:41.600
profits from this high
margin item, impulse item,

169
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.867
rolls of candy, ah,
chewing gum, things of

170
00:12:45.867 --> 00:12:47.834
that sort.

171
00:12:47.834 --> 00:12:53.533
But if you really conduct
an analysis of this, this

172
00:12:53.533 --> 00:12:57.967
program from the retail,
retailers' standpoint,

173
00:12:57.967 --> 00:13:01.900
it's really not a
high-profit situation for

174
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.166
the retailer.

175
00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:10.567
For example, we earlier
had said that the typical

176
00:13:10.567 --> 00:13:14.567
retailer, an average
retailer would have annual

177
00:13:14.567 --> 00:13:20.533
sales of $3,640.

178
00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:24.600
Yet if you look closely at
the cost of the product to

179
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:32.900
that retailer, at $205
per, per pack, buying 16

180
00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:37.467
packs a year to fulfill
consumer demand, the

181
00:13:37.467 --> 00:13:44.233
retailers' product cost
alone is almost $3,300,

182
00:13:44.233 --> 00:13:47.734
leaving the retailer a
profit, or at least a

183
00:13:47.734 --> 00:13:50.433
margin, of $360.

184
00:13:50.433 --> 00:13:55.100
My question to you is are
the retailers being well

185
00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.266
compensated for
participating in this

186
00:13:57.266 --> 00:14:00.767
program considering the
things they are going to

187
00:14:00.767 --> 00:14:07.133
have to do now in order to
ah, get the product from

188
00:14:07.133 --> 00:14:08.934
Sugar Sweets.

189
00:14:08.934 --> 00:14:13.200
They're going to have be
their, their own inventory

190
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.967
control managers, they're
going to have to go

191
00:14:15.967 --> 00:14:20.400
through to the time and effort to place calls for reorders.

192
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.734
They have to receive the orders. They have to unpack the orders.

193
00:14:24.734 --> 00:14:28.834
They have to restock
the display shelves.

194
00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:30.967
And we haven't even
considered the fact that

195
00:14:30.967 --> 00:14:33.934
this may well be the type
of product of which there

196
00:14:33.934 --> 00:14:37.600
is a fair amount of, of
pilferage and therefore a

197
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:44.333
lot of the product may,
let's say, disappear and

198
00:14:44.333 --> 00:14:47.333
not represent an actual sale.

199
00:14:47.333 --> 00:14:50.467
So the question is, are
the retailers really being

200
00:14:50.467 --> 00:14:59.700
well compensated for their participation in the program.

201
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:04.266
A conclusion to the
Sugar Sweets' case.

202
00:15:04.266 --> 00:15:06.800
If you think about the
changing environment that

203
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.200
Sugar Sweets was facing
and you think about the

204
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:15.867
actual consumer buying
process for this type of

205
00:15:15.867 --> 00:15:20.934
product ah, an impulse
item, an item that

206
00:15:20.934 --> 00:15:23.600
consumers don't really
think about buying until

207
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.767
they're exposed to
it, it's likely very

208
00:15:27.767 --> 00:15:33.333
appropriate that some form
of distribution that gets

209
00:15:33.333 --> 00:15:37.767
the product into different
types of retail outlets in

210
00:15:37.767 --> 00:15:41.433
fact is quite appropriate.

211
00:15:41.433 --> 00:15:46.700
However, in our analysis
of the alternative being

212
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:51.200
considered by Sugar Sweets
suggests to me at least,

213
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.367
that the, their proposed
solution is not very

214
00:15:54.367 --> 00:15:57.867
likely to succeed.

215
00:15:57.867 --> 00:16:04.033
Now subsequent to the
actual situation described

216
00:16:04.033 --> 00:16:08.567
in Sugar Sweets - and
Sugar Sweets also came to

217
00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:11.500
the conclusion that that
solution was not likely to

218
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:17.200
succeed - Sugar Sweets
prepared a, a lot of

219
00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:22.633
information and a lot of
data to present to their

220
00:16:22.633 --> 00:16:25.633
existing distribution
channel partners, the

221
00:16:25.633 --> 00:16:29.333
candy and tobacco
distributors, and through

222
00:16:29.333 --> 00:16:31.734
a result of a lot
of discussion and

223
00:16:31.734 --> 00:16:35.433
negotiation, many of
those jobbers came to the

224
00:16:35.433 --> 00:16:38.200
conclusion that it would
in fact be in their best

225
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:42.900
interest to extend their
efforts in selling to, to

226
00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:47.533
retailers and attempt
- and in fact were very

227
00:16:47.533 --> 00:16:51.734
successful in placing
Sugar Sweets' product into

228
00:16:51.734 --> 00:16:55.133
a lot of outlets that
previously had never been

229
00:16:55.133 --> 00:16:58.433
considered as likely
types of outlets for Sugar

230
00:16:58.433 --> 00:17:00.500
Sweets' products.

231
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:04.233
Today you can find the
type of product sold by

232
00:17:04.233 --> 00:17:07.066
Sugar Sweets in a lot of
places that it was not

233
00:17:07.066 --> 00:17:09.533
available at that time.

234
00:17:09.533 --> 00:17:13.533
You can find snack
products in hardware stores.

235
00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:19.100
You can find snack
products in video rental stores.

236
00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:22.967
You can find them in toy
stores and many, many

237
00:17:22.967 --> 00:17:26.533
other types of outlets
that prior to the time of

238
00:17:26.533 --> 00:17:30.500
this case had never been
considered as appropriate

239
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:30.500
outlets for snack-type products.
