1
00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:03.166
In this session we're
going to begin our

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:06.400
analysis of the alt -
the case Alternative

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.467
Distribution at Sugar
Sweets, Incorporated.

4
00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:15.200
Ah, now in Sugar Sweets,
Incorporated, the case

5
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:22.533
situation is one in which
Sugar Sweets has some ah,

6
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:25.467
unhappiness with the
current distribution

7
00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:28.300
channels and is
considering a totally

8
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.934
alternative form
of distribution.

9
00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:36.100
Well, let's look first
at the demand side of the

10
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.800
analysis for Sugar Sweets.

11
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.433
What is it that management
at Sugar Sweets is

12
00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:47.934
thinking about and why
are, why do they think an

13
00:00:47.934 --> 00:00:52.066
alternative distribution
channel is necessary?

14
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:56.467
Well, the first question
I asked you to consider is

15
00:00:56.467 --> 00:00:59.667
to think about the
consumers and think about

16
00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:02.900
their service output
demands and think about

17
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.734
their buyer behavior.

18
00:01:06.734 --> 00:01:11.500
How do people buy this
snack, these snack products?

19
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.533
These products are small
uh, candy items, mints,

20
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.700
ah, and things of that sort.

21
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.667
Well, what is the lot size
purchase when one buys

22
00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:26.133
this type of product?

23
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:30.300
Generally, when most of
us, most consumers, not

24
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.533
all - again there are
segments of consumers -

25
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:38.600
but in general, the lot
size purchase is quite

26
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.734
small, one or two rolls
of candy mints, one or two

27
00:01:43.734 --> 00:01:47.500
packages of chewing
gum at a time.

28
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.700
How much locational
convenience is required

29
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.433
for these types of products?

30
00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:57.467
How intensively
distributed do they need to be?

31
00:01:57.467 --> 00:02:02.166
Well, given the nature of
the product, consumers are

32
00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:05.700
not going to spend a lot
time searching for them,

33
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.000
so locational convenience
is extremely crit - critical.

34
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.333
What is the consumers' demand for variety and assortment?

35
00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:19.000
Well, certainly different
people have different

36
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.433
preferences for flavor
of candy, flavor of mint

37
00:02:23.433 --> 00:02:27.166
products, ah, some
like cherry, some like

38
00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:30.734
pineapple, some like
the rolls that have an

39
00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:36.533
assortment of flavors, but
the assortment demand is,

40
00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:40.433
is still somewhat small.

41
00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:45.633
How long is a consumer
willing to wait to receive

42
00:02:45.633 --> 00:02:48.600
this product once
they've ordered it?

43
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.667
And that answer to that
is they're not willing to

44
00:02:51.667 --> 00:02:55.333
wait in most instances.

45
00:02:55.333 --> 00:02:58.834
So Sugar Sweets,
Incorporated apparently

46
00:02:58.834 --> 00:03:02.900
thinks that ah, the
shopping or buyer behavior

47
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.000
of most consumers for this
product falls into the

48
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.834
upper left-hand corner
of that, of the Bucklin Matrix.

49
00:03:13.834 --> 00:03:16.867
In other words, consumers
buy the most available

50
00:03:16.867 --> 00:03:20.133
brand at the most
available outlet.

51
00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:23.633
They don't really do a
lot of comparison; they

52
00:03:23.633 --> 00:03:26.767
certainly don't visit
different outlets looking

53
00:03:26.767 --> 00:03:28.734
for this product.

54
00:03:28.734 --> 00:03:32.200
This is the - this product
category, at least in the

55
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.467
mind of management at
Sugar Sweets, falls into

56
00:03:35.467 --> 00:03:40.667
the true convenience
product, convenience store

57
00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:43.467
type of shopping behavior.

58
00:03:43.467 --> 00:03:48.200
In fact, management at ah,
Sugar, at the company that

59
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.533
we are calling Sugar
Sweets, made the statement

60
00:03:51.533 --> 00:03:55.734
to those of us at Michigan
State is that this type of

61
00:03:55.734 --> 00:04:02.533
product is the ultimate in
terms of impulse purchase.

62
00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:06.133
And by that what he meant
is consumers don't even

63
00:04:06.133 --> 00:04:08.900
think about buying this
product until they're

64
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.700
exposed to it.

65
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.800
So once they're exposed to
it, it comes to mind that

66
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.033
hmm, maybe I would like to
have a, a roll of mints or

67
00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:25.066
maybe I would like to
have a package of gum.

68
00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:28.767
And so from their
standpoint, the more

69
00:04:28.767 --> 00:04:33.433
outlets available, the better.

70
00:04:33.433 --> 00:04:40.333
Now from the supply side,
how this product has, has

71
00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:45.867
gotten made available to
the end users, ah, there's

72
00:04:45.867 --> 00:04:48.667
- the case tells us that
there've been many changes

73
00:04:48.667 --> 00:04:53.100
in the environment, many
changes taking place.

74
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.033
The current intermediaries
that used by Sugar Sweets

75
00:04:57.033 --> 00:04:59.633
are full-service wholesalers.

76
00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:02.467
In fact, they're a type
of wholesaler typically

77
00:05:02.467 --> 00:05:06.433
referred to as a "candy
and tobacco jobber."

78
00:05:06.433 --> 00:05:09.633
These wholesalers have
a sales force, these

79
00:05:09.633 --> 00:05:12.834
wholesalers carry
inventory, they generally

80
00:05:12.834 --> 00:05:17.600
have deep assortment, they
carry multiple ah, brands

81
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.967
representing multiple
manufacturers.

82
00:05:20.967 --> 00:05:24.834
Their sales force calls
on retail outlets.

83
00:05:24.834 --> 00:05:30.000
Ah, they take the orders
from the retail outlets.

84
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Generally, the sales
forces of these

85
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.567
wholesalers actually are
the ones who look at the

86
00:05:35.567 --> 00:05:39.633
retailers' inventory and
then go to the retailer

87
00:05:39.633 --> 00:05:43.133
and tell the retailer
"based on your current

88
00:05:43.133 --> 00:05:48.700
inventory, this is what you need to replenish your shelf."

89
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.100
The wholesalers provide
delivery to the store.

90
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.200
Typically, they even stock
the retailers' shelf.

91
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.900
They give the retailer
credit ah, credit terms,

92
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.633
they're really true
full-service wholesalers.

93
00:06:06.633 --> 00:06:09.934
And they're reluctant to
service the new types of

94
00:06:09.934 --> 00:06:14.500
accounts that are
desired by Sugar Sweets.

95
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.533
In fact, these current
wholesalers are very, very

96
00:06:19.533 --> 00:06:24.900
ah, comfortable in their
current role and in what

97
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.667
they are currently doing
in serving the types of

98
00:06:27.667 --> 00:06:30.533
accounts they are
currently serving.

99
00:06:30.533 --> 00:06:33.467
You might say from the
standpoint of Sugar

100
00:06:33.467 --> 00:06:37.700
Sweets, these wholesalers
are complacent.

101
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.433
They don't want to - they
don't have the desire to,

102
00:06:41.433 --> 00:06:45.066
to service of the
types of accounts.

103
00:06:45.066 --> 00:06:47.934
They're not willing to
put forth the effort of

104
00:06:47.934 --> 00:06:50.433
serving the other
types of accounts.

105
00:06:50.433 --> 00:06:56.900
And so Sugar Sweets is
considering a new concept

106
00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.667
and this, this information
is taken directly from the

107
00:07:00.667 --> 00:07:05.166
case so I just want to
highlight a few aspects of

108
00:07:05.166 --> 00:07:10.000
the alternative dis - of
the alternative channel.

109
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.934
What Sugar Sweets is
considering doing is

110
00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:20.100
providing to ah, retail
outlets ah, pre-prepared

111
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.500
display units of their
most popular items.

112
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:29.600
And these items will be
restocked by having the

113
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:35.166
retailer ah, place
telephone orders and then

114
00:07:35.166 --> 00:07:38.867
with, directly with Sugar
Sweets, and then Sugar

115
00:07:38.867 --> 00:07:42.000
Sweets will use rapid
small package delivery

116
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.367
service to ship the
restock displays to the

117
00:07:47.367 --> 00:07:49.633
retail store.

118
00:07:49.633 --> 00:07:52.467
They say minimal effort is
required on the retailers'

119
00:07:52.467 --> 00:07:56.600
part because of the
popularity of Sugar Sweets

120
00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.967
brands and another
advantage for the

121
00:08:00.967 --> 00:08:04.667
retailers is that product
will be fresher by direct

122
00:08:04.667 --> 00:08:07.500
- because of direct shipment.

123
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.400
And they emphasize the
incremental money made by the

124
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.500
retailer from selling
these high profit impulse

125
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.533
snack foods ah, will
involve no risk for the

126
00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:22.667
retailer since Sugar
Sweets will remove

127
00:08:22.667 --> 00:08:26.200
slow-moving product at no cost.

128
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.900
So it's an interesting
concept and one that Sugar

129
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.967
Sweets has ah, done a
lot of market research in

130
00:08:34.967 --> 00:08:39.200
trying to develop
estimates of, of sales and

131
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:44.066
pro - expenses and profit.

132
00:08:44.066 --> 00:08:47.633
But they do think, do
recognize that this

133
00:08:47.633 --> 00:08:52.767
alternative channel ah,
changes substantially all

134
00:08:52.767 --> 00:08:56.333
of the flows and
functional performance in,

135
00:08:56.333 --> 00:08:58.900
in the distribution channel.

136
00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:05.800
Currently ah, currently
retailers who sell these

137
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.233
types of products really
put very little effort

138
00:09:09.233 --> 00:09:11.433
into the process.

139
00:09:11.433 --> 00:09:16.834
The candy and tobacco jobbers essentially do everything.

140
00:09:16.834 --> 00:09:20.333
They count the retailers'
inventory, they at least

141
00:09:20.333 --> 00:09:26.333
suggest what the retailer
needs in terms of restock

142
00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:32.734
or resupply, ah, and in
the alternative channel

143
00:09:32.734 --> 00:09:37.066
those functions and those
jobs are going, are not

144
00:09:37.066 --> 00:09:40.533
going to be done
by a wholesaler.

145
00:09:40.533 --> 00:09:44.000
Just remember something
we've said several times;

146
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.467
you can eliminate
channel participate -

147
00:09:47.467 --> 00:09:52.533
participants, but you
cannot eliminate what they do.

148
00:09:52.533 --> 00:09:57.667
So in fact, although Sugar
Sweets talks about the

149
00:09:57.667 --> 00:10:00.467
simplicity of the
alternative channel for

150
00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:04.066
the retailer, there're
many things that the

151
00:10:04.066 --> 00:10:07.533
retailer is going to have
to do that in the in the

152
00:10:07.533 --> 00:10:11.867
existing distribution
channel they're done by

153
00:10:11.867 --> 00:10:17.667
the candy and
tobacco jobbers.

154
00:10:17.667 --> 00:10:20.900
So let's take a look
at the specific case

155
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:25.333
questions as we
undertake our analysis.

156
00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:29.233
Ah, Sugar Sweets, based on
its market research, has

157
00:10:29.233 --> 00:10:33.767
developed a lot of
data about retailers.

158
00:10:33.767 --> 00:10:37.333
Ah, they've estimated
that the total number of

159
00:10:37.333 --> 00:10:43.433
possible retailers that,
that might be interested

160
00:10:43.433 --> 00:10:46.700
in participating in this
alternative distribution

161
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.667
channel at 820,000.

162
00:10:50.667 --> 00:10:53.300
They estimate that they
can initially contact

163
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:59.700
about 20% of those,
or about 164,000.

164
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.266
They estimate then that
there's going to be a

165
00:11:02.266 --> 00:11:06.367
pretrial period or ah,
there's going to be a

166
00:11:06.367 --> 00:11:12.166
trial period and they
estimate of the 164,000

167
00:11:12.166 --> 00:11:17.000
retailers contacted,
about 30% of those will be

168
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.100
interested and will
participate in the trial.

169
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:27.100
After the six-month trial,
they estimate that 55% of

170
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:33.266
those who participated in
the trial will remain in

171
00:11:33.266 --> 00:11:36.300
and want to continue
distributing and selling

172
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.834
Sugar Sweets' products.

173
00:11:38.834 --> 00:11:41.500
In other words, ultimately
they're estimating a

174
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:46.967
little over 27,000
retailers will participate

175
00:11:46.967 --> 00:11:53.633
ah, after the
six-month trial period.

176
00:11:53.633 --> 00:11:57.233
Now the question, the
second case question,

177
00:11:57.233 --> 00:12:04.166
deals with the average
sales by the average retailer.

178
00:12:04.166 --> 00:12:06.967
And so we need to look
at that first of all on a

179
00:12:06.967 --> 00:12:10.767
daily basis, and then
secondly we'll look at

180
00:12:10.767 --> 00:12:13.934
that - we'll translate
that daily basis to an

181
00:12:13.934 --> 00:12:19.700
annual basis of what will
be the average retailer's sales.

182
00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:27.867
So they expect the average
number of paying consumers

183
00:12:27.867 --> 00:12:33.200
ah, at each retail store
will ultimately be ten

184
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.500
customers will actually
pay and buy Sugar Sweets

185
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.500
product in the
average retail store.

186
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:47.734
Furthermore, they, they do
project a relatively low lot size.

187
00:12:47.734 --> 00:12:51.133
In other words, the
average customer will buy

188
00:12:51.133 --> 00:12:57.667
only slightly over one unit.

189
00:12:57.667 --> 00:13:00.934
So it means ultimately
that the ten customers

190
00:13:00.934 --> 00:13:07.934
would, per day, would buy
11.2 units on average.

191
00:13:07.934 --> 00:13:12.300
So the projected sales
dollars per day for the

192
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:16.734
ten customers would be $14.

193
00:13:16.734 --> 00:13:21.867
On an annual basis then,
considering 260 days per

194
00:13:21.867 --> 00:13:29.567
year (they're not thinking
365 days a year), ah, the

195
00:13:29.567 --> 00:13:34.500
annual number of customer,
retail customers would be -

196
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.467
customers, consumers rather,
the average number of

197
00:13:37.467 --> 00:13:42.100
consumers would be 2600
and the projected sales

198
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:46.233
dollars per year
ultimately ah, for each

199
00:13:46.233 --> 00:13:55.000
retailer would be on
average a little over $3600.

200
00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.100
Now question number three
begins, or look at what

201
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:04.266
will be necessary in
order on the part of Sugar

202
00:14:04.266 --> 00:14:08.934
Sweets in order to service
this expected demand at

203
00:14:08.934 --> 00:14:11.266
the retail level.

204
00:14:11.266 --> 00:14:16.400
And they talk about having
large packs and small packs.

205
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:22.133
The large packs will hold
180 individual units; the

206
00:14:22.133 --> 00:14:28.066
small packs will
hold 92 of, of these.

207
00:14:28.066 --> 00:14:32.834
So on average what we're
saying is that the average

208
00:14:32.834 --> 00:14:37.400
retailer who wants the
large packs would need

209
00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:43.834
16.18, or let's just - for
simplicity purposes the

210
00:14:43.834 --> 00:14:47.066
average retailer who wants
the large packs would

211
00:14:47.066 --> 00:14:51.533
place 16 orders each year.

212
00:14:51.533 --> 00:14:55.066
The typical retailer or
average retailer who wants

213
00:14:55.066 --> 00:15:01.667
the small packs - that,
that retailer would place

214
00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:05.600
approximately or for
simplicity purposes, let's

215
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:10.700
say 32 orders per year.

216
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.867
Now in our next session
we're going to continue

217
00:15:13.867 --> 00:15:16.867
with this quantitative
analysis and take a look

218
00:15:16.867 --> 00:15:22.000
at the costs to Sugar
Sweets of fulfilling this

219
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.567
type of ordering pattern
on the part of the

220
00:15:25.567 --> 00:15:30.300
retailers and we'll look
then at the profitability

221
00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.633
and finally we will
conduct some other

222
00:15:34.633 --> 00:15:38.266
analysis of what other
factors does Sugar Sweets

223
00:15:38.266 --> 00:15:42.767
need to consider other
than just these, these

224
00:15:42.767 --> 00:15:48.900
estimates of sales
and expenses and profitability.

225
00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.567
So your assignment for
next time is to answer the

226
00:15:51.567 --> 00:15:55.233
last two questions and
think about the other

227
00:15:55.233 --> 00:15:55.233
factors that need to
be considered by Sugar Sweets.
